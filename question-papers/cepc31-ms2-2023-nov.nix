          Design a circular water tank resting on ground, having capacity of
          2,00,000 litres of water using approximate method. Assume concrete
          of grade M25 and steel of Fe500.

          A concrete beam of dimension 100mm X 300mm is pre-tensioned with 5
          straight wires of 7mm diameter over its complete length of 6m. The
          anchorage slip of 5mm is observed. The average prestress after
          short-term losses is 0.7fpk = 1200N/mm^2 and the age of loading is
          given as 28 days. Given that Ep = 200 X 10^3 Mpa , Ec = 35000 Mpa,
          relative humidity as 80%. Determine the losses of prestress. Neglect
          the weight of the beam in the computation of the stresses
