# Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of data models and conceptualize a database system for user requirements.
- Study the fundamentals of database query language, like SQL and relational algebra.
- Learn the concept of normalization in database design.
- Learn fundamental concepts of transaction processing, concurrency control techniques, and database recovery procedures.
- Understand the professional, ethical, and security issues and responsibilities in database design.
