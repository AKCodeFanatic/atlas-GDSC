# Objectives

- Understand the concept of data types, variables, assignments, and conditional statements in Python.
- Learn how to manipulate files and directories using Python and its os and sys modules.
- Understand the usage of Python libraries and how to work with Strings and text files.
- Learn about data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries in Python and their operations like searching and sorting.
- Understand the basics of Simple Graphics and Image Processing using the turtle and image modules.
- Learn about Classes and OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading in Python.
- Learn how to create GUIs using tkinter module and understand event-driven programming in Python.

# Content

## Unit 1

1. **Introduction to Python:**
   - Data types; variables, assignments; immutable variables; numerical types; arithmetic operators and expressions; comments in the program; understanding error messages.
   - Conditions, boolean logic, logical operators, and ranges.
   - Control statements: if-else, loops (for, while); short-circuit (lazy) evaluation.
   - Strings and text files: manipulating files and directories, os and sys modules; reading/writing text and numbers from/to a file; creating and reading a formatted file (csv or tab-separated).
   
2. **Data Structures:**
   - Lists, tuples, and dictionaries: basic list operators, replacing, inserting, removing an element; searching and sorting lists; dictionary literals, adding and removing keys, accessing and replacing values; traversing dictionaries.
   - Design with functions: hiding redundancy, complexity; arguments and return values; formal vs actual arguments, named arguments.

## Unit 2

1. **Simple Graphics and Image Processing:**
   - Turtle module: simple 2d drawing - colors, shapes.
   - Digital images, image file formats, image processing: Simple image manipulations with 'image' module (convert to bw, grayscale, blur, etc).

2. **Classes and OOP:**
   - Classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
   - Defining classes; design with classes, data modeling; persistent storage of objects.
   - Inheritance, polymorphism, operator overloading (_eq_, _str_, etc); abstract classes.
   - Exception handling, try block.

## Unit 3

1. **GUI Programming:**
   - Graphical user interfaces; event-driven programming paradigm.
   - Tkinter module, creating simple GUI; buttons, labels, entry fields, dialogs.
   - Widget attributes - sizes, fonts, colors, layouts, nested frames.

# Outcomes

- Write Python programs that solve simple business problems.
- Create Python applications that are robust and multithreaded.
- Write simple GUI interfaces for a program to interact with users, and understand the event-based GUI handling principles in Python.
