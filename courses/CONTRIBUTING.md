# Contributing to courses

Hey! Thank you so much for willing to contribute to one of the goals NKSSS attempts to achieve. Please refer below on how to contribute.

## Steps to contribute

- Copy the contents of the [template file](/courses/!%20TEMPLATE%20!.md),
- Click "Add file" > "Create new file" on the repository's page.
- Enter `courses/<name>.md` as the file name where `<name>` should be replaced by course code.
- Paste the contents of the template and populate the values from the [syllabus PDF](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1v7SuQj0RJJbz_r5xLSqj8feV6T8t9UT8).
- Some notes about the structure of the file:
  - Remove all unnecessary entries inside `specifics` if the given course does not exist for those branches.
  - Do not create new empty lines other than the ones already present in the template.
  - If a given unit does not have any major topic, do not use the numbered lists. Refer [ECPC71.md](./ECPC71.md) and the [ECE syllabus PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IUDACGOHCO3h-vhx-G8ofwrD3LUfqTP-) to understand what I'm trying to say.
- Commit this file. It will send a PR which I will review.
