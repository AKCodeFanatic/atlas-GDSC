# Course Learning Objectives:

1. Understand computer network basic, different models used for study of computer networks, ability to
   identify different designs, understanding of the issues surrounding wired and wireless Networks.
2. Design, calculate, and apply subnet masks to fulfill networking requirements and building the skills of
   routing mechanisms.
3. Analyze the features and operations of various application layer protocols such as Http, DNS, SMTP
   and FTP.
4. Analyze the requirements for a given organizational structure and select the most appropriate
   networking architecture and technologies.
5. Familiarity with the basic protocols of computer networks, and how they can be used to assist in
   network design and implementation.
