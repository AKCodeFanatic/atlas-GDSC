# Atlas

A map of all the hand-crafted courses and potentially other material in the future!

## What do you currently store?

As of now, we only store the data for every courses that the college has to offer. We're in the process of adding more and more courses as we go. If you would like to help out, please refer our [contribution guidelines](/courses/CONTRIBUTING.md) :)

## Why GitHub?

Course data has been something that we failed to automate. So, we decided to get help from willing folks who are thrilled to help for the greater good. There are 2 reasons why we chose GitHub:

- Some of the course data has to be stored in markdown format (the file you're reading right now is a Markdown!). Since we are getting help from others, there needs to be screening of the uploads. This is made easier with GitHub's native markdown renderer.

- If we store the courses on GitHub, virtually anyone can hop in and help with this mission without worrying about how the internal code works. As an added bonus, your contributions will engraved on this repository!
