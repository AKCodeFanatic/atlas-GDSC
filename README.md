# Atlas

A map of all the hand-crafted courses and potentially other material in the future!

## What do you currently store?

As of now, we store 3 things:

1. The syllabi for every courses that the college has to offer.
2. Some subjective lab work that students can simply view and refer from.
3. Question papers. We store these in plain-text format that can be processed into a PDF (see [README](/question-papers/README.md) for more information)

We're in the process of adding more courses and question papers as we go. If you would like to help out, please refer our [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) :)

## Why GitHub?

Course data has been something that we failed to automate. So, we decided to get help from willing folks who are thrilled to help for the greater good. There are 2 reasons why we chose GitHub:

- Some of the course data has to be stored in markdown format (the file you're reading right now is a Markdown!). Since we are getting help from others, there needs to be screening of the uploads. This is made easier with GitHub's native markdown renderer.

- If we store the courses on GitHub, virtually anyone can hop in and help with this mission without worrying about how the internal code works. As an added bonus, your contributions will engraved on this repository!
