# NKSS-academic
A store for hand-crafted notes and other material!

## But this respository is... empty?
I don't wish to push anything here until I have settled on the directory layout and have enough content to work on. This will take a while, since we, NKSSS, have a lot on our plate at the moment!

## Why GitHub?
As a scope of this repository, I wish to convert into its own API with some handy endpoints! This will not only fit into our micro-service architecture beautifully, but it will also aid as a convenient source of information with little to no 3rd party dependencies.

Another benefit of this platform would be a single spot for all contributions to our project.

## When will this repository hold content?
By the end of this year (2022), this repository should have academic material for a few CS courses.
